# Youtube-Downloader
Youtube Downloader made in python using pytube and tkinter /.exe

Actually this app is so simple, a big console/cmd showing you what is happening and 3 buttons and a box field to paste an url:

Select dir: choose where do you want to export the final video

download video/audio: necessary to explain?

maybe my code it is not the cleanest you ever seen, i did it to work in any situation that you miss some files or the path.txt
